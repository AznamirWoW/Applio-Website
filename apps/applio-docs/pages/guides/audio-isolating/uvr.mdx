# Audio isolating with UVR5

Ultimate vocal remover (UVR) is an Free and Open Source AI audio editing tool with the ability to remove stems and other objects from a base audio. It is possible to execute the program through several ways, this section will explain how to use each of them.
<Steps>
## Alternative 1: Locally execution
### Download UVR5

To start using uvr locally, download and install the program via https://ultimatevocalremover.com/

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
When running the installer, Windows may mistakenly detect it as malware due to the lack of a license. If you have any concerns, you can review the program's source code or use alternative installation methods.

### Download Models 
When inside UVR, you first need to download separation models.

- Click on the wrench icon.
- Go to “Download Center”.
- Choose your preferred models.

In the section you will find models structures, these are one of the best known:
<Tabs items={['RoPE Transformer', 'MDX-Net', 'Vr Arch', 'Demucs']}>

  <Tabs.Tab>
  **RoPE Transformer** utilizes a Band-Split module to convert the input complex spectrogram into representations at the subband level *(currently the best)*. 
  
  The Rope Transformer method contains two pretrained models, **BS-RoFormer** and **Mel-Band RoFormer**, which contain similar but not same structures, currently the best versions of these models are:

 - **BS-Roformer-Viperx-1297**
 - **Mel-Roformer-Viperx-1143**

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  **MDX-net** is a prize-winning model framework from an ML enthusiasts contest, designed for audio source separation and enabling improvements from a base model.


   - **MDX23C-InstVoc HQ:** A set of different models that works to deliver a single result.
  - **UVR-MDX-NET Voc FT:** Model focused mainly on separating vocals.
  - **UVR-MDX-NET Crowd HQ 1:** separate background vocals from a main one.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
**Vr-Arch** is a location-guided audio-visual spatial audio separator model, capable of giving great results in most tasks.

  - **UVR-DeEcho-DeReverb:** Separate Reverb and echo.
  - **UVR-BVE-4B_SN-44100-1:** Multiple background voices separator.
  - **5_Hp-Karaoke-UVR:** Separate Background vocals (best one).
  - **UVR-DeNoise:** Separate Noise and some artifacts.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
   **Demucs** is an all-in-one model capable of separating most objects from an audio between 4 to 6 stems. Being their best version of DemucsV4. 
  - **Demucs:** Default Model, normal proccesing time and good results.
  - **Demucs_FT:** Slow processing but better results.
  - **Demucs_6s:** Capability of separing Guitar and Piano stems.
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs> 
### Make the Audio conversion

When the models have been downloaded, you can go back to the home screen to make your separation.

- Select the desired structure and the downloaded model.
- Select your audio, it can be easily downloaded from sites such as [Cobalt.Tools](https://cobalt.tools/)
- Select the output path for the results and click convert.

<FAQBox title="Other Options">
- **Window Size:** Change the audio processing bucket, a lower number indicates a much slower processing but a better worked result, and vice versa with a higher number.
- **Aggression Settings:** Change the aggressiveness with which the separation will be performed, a higher number can eat important frequencies of the audio.
</FAQBox>

*(This small application applies to any alternative that runs the GUI version of the program.)*

## Alternative 2: MVSEP

MVSEP is a website belonging to the **UVR team** which offers a fast and direct way to use the software in the cloud with a free version and paid upgrades.

To use mvsep, it is as easy as enter to their website (https://mvsep.com/) and registering.


## Alternative 3: Google Collab
