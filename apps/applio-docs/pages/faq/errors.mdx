# Errors 

Common general errors in RVC/Applio.

## Dependencies

When installing Applio using the conda method, all necessary dependencies are included in the conda environment. You do not need to install any additional packages.

## Error Downloading Miniconda

If there are issues with automatically downloading Miniconda, download it [manually](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_23.9.0-0-Windows-x86_64.exe) and install it.

## Conda Error Building Wheels

If Conda shows an error related to the "Wheels" dependency, ensure that Visual Studio Build Tools are installed. The installer should handle this automatically, but verify if needed.

## Tensorboard or Dependency Error

If you encounter an error related to Tensorboard, it likely means dependencies were not installed correctly. Ensure you have the [latest installer version](/get-started/Installation.md).

Also, check the following:

- Did you install Applio in a directory with spaces or non-ASCII characters in the path? If so, reinstall Applio in a directory without spaces or non-ASCII characters (e.g., the root of your C: drive).
- Was the antivirus/firewall enabled during installation? If so, disable the antivirus and reinstall Applio.
- Did you open the `run-applio.bat` file with administrator privileges? If so, open it without administrator privileges.

## Situation with Google Colab

Google Colab is currently unavailable due to restrictions by Google. Our team has restored access to Applio. [More information here](/get-started/Alternatives.md).

## FFmpeg Error / UTF-8 Error

Ensure that all file paths are free of special characters.

## Connection Error

Ensure that the console (black command line window) remains open.

## WebUI Popup: 'Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)'

Disable any system LAN proxy/global proxy and refresh the page.

## CUDA Error / CUDA Out of Memory

Adjust the batch size for training. For inference, modify settings in `config.py`. Consider upgrading your GPU if necessary.

## File/Memory Error (During Training)

Reduce the "Number of CPU threads" or pre-cut the training set into shorter audio files.

## Error Regarding llvmlite.dll

Install [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) for Windows.

## RuntimeError: The expanded size of the tensor...

Delete smaller-sized WAV files, then click "train the model" and "train the index."

## RuntimeError: The size of tensor a must match...

Avoid changing the sampling rate mid-training. If necessary, change the experiment name and train from scratch or copy the pitch and features folders to accelerate training.

## The Filename, Directory Name, or Volume Label Syntax is Incorrect

Ensure that the dataset path is correctly set before training. The dataset should not be in a zip file within the `Applio/assets/datasets` folder.

## IndexError: List Index Out of Range

Use the same sample rate when retraining or selecting a custom pretrain.

## Alternative

If all else fails, download the precompiled (Zip or Exe) version. This version comes ready to use without requiring installation.
