## Alternative Installation Methods

### Precompiled Zip Version

If you encounter issues with the above method:

1. Download the zip from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/IAHispano/Applio/tree/main/Compiled/Windows).
2. Extract it.
3. Run `run-applio.bat`.

Follow the same preparation steps as mentioned in the Windows installation.

<Callout type="info">
  The precompiled zip version for Linux is currently under development. We are
  working diligently to provide this option for Linux users in the near future.
  In the meantime, please use the script installation method described above for
  Linux systems.

## AMD GPU Support (Windows)

For AMD GPU users, follow these steps to set up Applio using Zluda:

<Steps>

### Install VC++ Runtime

1. Download and install the [VC++ Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Install HIP SDK

1. Check the [System Requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/develop/reference/system-requirements.html).
2. In the "Windows-supported GPUs" section, determine your installation steps:

   a. If your GPU has a green checkbox in the HIP SDK column:

   - Install either v6.1.2 or v5.7.1 HIP SDK from [AMD ROCm Hub](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html).

   b. If your GPU is RX 6600, 6600XT, 6650XT, 6700, 6700XT, 6750XT:

   - Install v5.7.1 HIP SDK from [AMD ROCm Hub](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html).
   - For 6700, 6700XT, 6750XT, download [gfx1031 archive](https://github.com/brknsoul/ROCmLibs/raw/main/Optimised_ROCmLibs_gfx1031.7z).
   - For 6600, 6600XT, 6650XT, download [gfx1032 archive](https://github.com/brknsoul/ROCmLibs/raw/main/Optimised_ROCmLibs_gfx1032.7z).
   - Rename `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\bin\rocblas\library` to `library.old`.
   - Create a new folder named `library`.
   - Unzip the content of the archive into that folder.

   c. For all other AMD GPUs:

   - Find your gfxNNNN value by searching "techpowerup your_gpu" (listed under "Shader ISA" on the page).
   - For `gfx803, gfx900, gfx906, gfx1010, gfx1011, gfx1012, gfx1030, gfx1100, gfx1101, gfx1102` GPUs:
     - Install v5.7.1 HIP SDK from [AMD ROCm Hub](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html).
     - Download [this archive](https://github.com/brknsoul/ROCmLibs/raw/main/ROCmLibs.7z).
     - Rename `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\bin\rocblas\library` to `library.old`.
     - Unzip the content of the archive into `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\bin\rocblas\`.
   - For other GPUs:
     - Visit [this repository](https://github.com/likelovewant/ROCmLibs-for-gfx1103-AMD780M-APU) and follow the instructions there.

### Install Applio

1. Install [Python 3.10.11](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe) (check "Add Python to Path").
2. Download Applio v3.2.5 or higher source code zip from the [release page](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/releases).
3. Edit `run-install.bat` and update the Torch URL from `cu121` to `cu118`:
   ```
   pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```
4. Run `run-install.bat` to install the required Python libraries.

### Set up Zluda and Patch Torch Libraries

1. Move all .bat files from `assets\zluda` to the root Applio folder.
2. For HIP SDK 5.7:
   - Run `patch_zluda_hip57.bat`.
   - Add `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\bin` to your system's Path environment variable.
3. For HIP SDK 6.1:
   - Run `patch_zluda_hip61.bat`.
   - Add `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\6.1\bin` to your system's Path environment variable.

### Start Applio

1. It's assumed your primary AMD GPU has index 0. If your iGPU is listed first under 'Display Adapters' in Device Manager, edit the `run-applio-amd.bat` file and change the value from "0" to "1".
2. Run `run-applio-amd.bat` to start Applio.

### Initial Compilation

Note that the first time Zluda encounters a new computational task, it compiles the kernel code. During this time, there's no output and Applio may appear frozen. Initial compilation can take 15-20 minutes.

</Steps>

## Updating and Uninstalling

- **To update:** Delete the current Applio folder and reinstall. Save your audios and models first.
- **To uninstall:** Simply delete the Applio folder.
