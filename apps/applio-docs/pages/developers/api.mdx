# Applio API

Create, experiment and develop; fast and public.

### What is the Applio API?

Applio API is the key that allows request and access in _a few clicks_ a quantity of _+20k voice models created using RVC technology totally free_. This is done through our database, with which the [Applio Bot](https://applio.org/bot) and the [Website](https://applio.org/models) works.

**How to access and use the Applio API?**

- Go to the [Applio website](https://applio.org/), register, and once you have done so, you can go to the [API](https://applio.org/api) section and create a key.
